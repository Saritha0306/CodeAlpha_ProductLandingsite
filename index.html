          <p>
            Most of the specs are pretty underwhelming: a 1.7GHz Intel Core i5-3317U "Ivy Bridge" processor, 750GB hard disk drive, DVD drive, a thickness of over an inch (that's considered plump in the age of the ultrabook), and a weight of 5.4 pounds.
But one hardware feature sets it apart from the Windows 7 rabble: a 15.6-inch touch screen to go with Windows 8's touch-centric interface.

          <h3></h3>
          <p>
            The system above has only a grainy 1,366 x768 15.6-inch screen.
Other Windows 8 systems appearing on HSN include a $ 699.95 Gateway laptop (no touch screen) and a $ 1,199.95 Gateway 23-inch All-in-One touch-screen desktop PC.

HSM does not state availability on its site. Windows 8 is slated to go on sale officially on October 26.
